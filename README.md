## Kaleidoscope-PrefixLayer

Based on [a cool trick from ilianaw][original], this plugin allows to to make all keys on a layer act as if they're prefixed by some keystroke.
The original use-case is for using Tmux or Screen - for example, you can have a layer of keys wherein all the keys in the layer act as if you've hit Control-B before the key.
